# MUN Minds

I worked with a mental health group, MUN Minds, to help build their Peer Support program. 
Students that needed to talk to someone could go to the MUN Minds office and recieve peer support. 
The organization was having students fill out feedback forms but were not tracking feedback or numbers of participants in any meaningful way.

I created this 'Database' to allow them to do this. 

Number of constrants:
    Must be friendly to non-tech people
        anyone from the organization must be able to input and read information from the Tracker. For this reason Google sheets was choosen. 
    Must be non-tec input
        discussion amongst the MUN Minds board feared that if students were asked to submit an electronic form, they wouldn't out of privacy concerns, 
        Students are passed a paper form, with ratings 1-5 and 1-10, on various criteria. Volunteers are then asked to digitize these forms.
